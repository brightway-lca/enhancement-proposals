## Abstract

A short (less than 200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

The `Abstract` section is important for producing high quality user-focused documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.

## Motivation

Clearly explain why the existing specifications is inadequate to address the problem that the BEP solves

## Proposal

Detailed description of the proposed idea of solution. Normative statements should follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Must include the following subsections (some of which are optional); additional sections may be added:

The proposal does not need to be exhaustive, if the proposed standards or software are otherwise available and well documented.

### Rationale

Mandatory. Describe why particular design decisions were made.

### Pros and Cons

Optional. May be free-form text or bullet lists

### Alternatives

Mandatory. Ideas that were not ultimately selected

### Open Issues

Optional. Relevant issues or questions not governed or resolved by this BEP

### Non-Goals

Optional. Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion and make progress

### Test plan and results

Mandatory. How can one show the usefulness of the proposal in practice? The test phase must be completed and results documented **before** the BEP vote.

## Discussion

Link to the GitHub Discussion for this BEP here. Also add a comprehensive bullet list of links to where the BEP has been discussed by the community, such as the Brightway developers mailing list, and Github pull requests and issues. For example:

* [BEP-0001 Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/brightway-lca/enhancement-proposals/discussions/01)
* The Brightway development discussion list, tagged with [#BEP0001](TODO)

A procedure to implement/reject modifications to the BEP shall be mentioned in the proposal. Depending on the type of BEP, examples can be one or more of the following options:

* BEP result of working groups already reflect some level of consensus, and will have a history of how the specifics came to be. In this case, the author will mention that the group is the primary and preliminary place for discussing the proposal, before it is made public.
* Once the BEP is public, the authors should publicly respond to suggested changes by either accepting the changes, or providing their reasons to reject the suggested changes.
* If discussion is particularly heated, the authors may invite changes via pull request which would be discussed by the community. To avoid voting overload, this procedure should only be used in special cases.
* Alternatively, the authors may invite dissenting discussion participants to phone or in-person conferences to reach consensus on difficult issues.
